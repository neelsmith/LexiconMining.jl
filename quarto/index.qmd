# Mining Lewis-Short's *Latin Dictionary*


`LexiconMining.jl` is an unpublished Julia package to extract latent morphological data from a digital edition of Lewis-Short's *Latin Dictionary*, and format it for use with the Tabulae system for building Latin morphological parsers.

In 2025, the `LexiconMining` package is being completely rewritten to use ChatGPT for the first round of data extraction. The process could be outlined as:

1. Use ChatGPT to extract morphological data from Christopher Blackwell's Markdown edition of Lewis-Short.
2. Parse the ChatGPT output into a Julia object model for each morphological type ("part of speech").
3. Create delimited-text representations of the data usable with [Tabulae](https://github.com/neelsmith/Tabulae.jl)
