9868|urn:cite2:hmt:ls.markdown:n9867|It seems you provided a snippet of a dictionary article with contextual information but not enough for a straightforward extraction into the desired format. I’ll clarify how to handle the most precise line of data possible based on the context.

For detailed processing, I'd need clearer structural organization—such as explicit lemma identification or part-of-speech markers in your Markdown dictionary. Provide a complete article to better demonstrate extraction!

Could you do that?
